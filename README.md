# DumbSlider, a trivial OS X application in Swift

This is an implementation of Apple's [Your First Mac App tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/RoadMapOSX/books/RM_YourFirstApp_Mac/Articles/Introduction.html) in its new [Swift programming lanugage](http://developer.apple.com/swift/).

It follows the tutorial as closely as possible, defining a Track class. It also features a very simple unit test.
